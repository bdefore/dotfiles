yay -S \
  swayidle \
  xorg_xlsclients \

# swayidle: used in sway config to trigger swaylock
# xorg-xlsclients: for diagnosing which apps are running x instead of wayland
# sworkstyle: replace waybar workspace numbers with icons
# fusuma: touchpad gestures

# wlsunset causes graphical issues on framework laptop when awakening from sleep
