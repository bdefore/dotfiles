# Dependency notes:
# linux-headers: needed for hid-fanatec-dkms, will prompt for kernel specific version
# hid-fanatec-dkms: verified to enable support for Fanatec Podium DD1 on ACC
# oversteer: gui for force feedback settings

# Not yet in AUR:
# protopedal: used to enable pedal support, verified with Simtrecs ProPedals
# https://gitlab.com/openirseny/protopedal

# protopedal usage:
# - lsusb # run when pedals are connected and verify are listed here
# - ls /dev/input/by-id # and note the event reference id of pedals
# download and build protopedal from source
# - ./protopedal --verbose --name Whatevs --product 0001 --buttons 1 /dev/input/by-id/YOUR_PEDAL_EVENT_ID
# at this opint you should see 'Mapping axis' on a few lines. if not, add --axis 4 (or some other integer)
# note that the --button 1 flag is a workaround in issue in proton?
